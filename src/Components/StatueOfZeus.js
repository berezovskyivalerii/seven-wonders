                Crafted by the renowned sculptor Phidias around 435 BC, the
                Statue of Zeus stood inside the Temple of Zeus in Olympia,
                Greece. It was over 12 meters (40 feet) tall and made of ivory
                and gold.

            </div>

            <p>
                The statue depicted Zeus seated on a grand throne, radiating
                divine authority. Though destroyed centuries later, it remains a
                masterpiece of ancient Greek artistry and religious devotion.
